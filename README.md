This repository contains the final implementation of a nearable rPPG monitoring system developed for the Laboratory of Nearable Technologies for Health Data Science. The system estimates heart rate from RGB facial videos, validates the results against synchronized CMS50D wearable pulse oximeter measurements, and adapts the live analysis according to detected head-motion patterns.

---
# Overview

The proposed framework estimates physiological parameters directly from facial videos while maintaining robustness under realistic acquisition conditions, including different head movements.

The system automatically classifies head motion patterns and dynamically adapts the signal-processing pipeline according to the detected motion scenario.

The proposed framework estimates:

- Heart Rate (HR)
- Respiratory Rate (RR)
- Blood Volume Pulse (BVP)
- Motion Classification Confidence
- Signal Quality Metrics

# Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Develop a robust contactless physiological monitoring system using RGB videos.
- Automatically classify head motion patterns.
- Adapt signal conditioning according to the detected motion type.
- Estimate heart rate under static and motion conditions.
- Recover respiratory information from heart-rate variability.
- Validate physiological estimates against wearable measurements.
- Build both offline and real-time implementations.

---

# Motivation

Traditional physiological monitoring systems require physical contact with the body and may become uncomfortable during long monitoring sessions. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) provides a non-contact alternative by extracting subtle skin color variations produced by blood circulation.

However, rPPG signals are highly sensitive to:

- Head motion
- Illumination variations
- Face tracking errors
- ROI displacement
- Motion artifacts

The goal of this project is to design a robust nearable monitoring system capable of operating reliably under realistic acquisition conditions

---

# Experimental Protocol

Three motion paradigms were considered.

## 1. Stable Baseline

The subject remains stationary and directly faces the camera.

**Purpose**
- Establish ideal acquisition conditions
- Determine upper-bound performance
- Measure baseline signal quality

---

## 2. Left-to-Right Rotation

The subject continuously performs horizontal head rotations.

**Purpose**
- Introduce ROI displacement
- Generate moderate motion artifacts
- Evaluate tracking robustness

---

## 3. Zigzag Motion

The subject performs combined horizontal and vertical head movements.

**Purpose**
- Create a challenging motion scenario
- Stress-test signal robustness
- Evaluate adaptive routing performance

# How to Run

## Live Pipeline

Before running the live script, connect the CMS50D pulse oximeter and check the active COM port.

Open the live script and update the configuration section if needed:

```python
CMS50D_PORT = "COM5"
WEBCAM_INDEX = 0
```

# Outputs

The live pipeline generates several output files during and after recording:

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `.avi` video | Raw webcam video saved without overlay graphics to preserve rPPG pixels |
| synchronized `.csv` file | Frame-level CMS50D and live rPPG measurements |
| motion-segment summary `.csv` | Final HR value for each detected motion segment |
| metric summary `.csv` | Overall HR error metrics and validation results |
| evaluation dashboard `.png` | Visual comparison between CMS50D reference and rPPG estimates |

Important CSV columns include:

- `CMS_Pulse_Rate_Hardware`
- `CMS_SpO2`
- `CMS_Waveform`
- `Live_rPPG_HR`
- `Live_Motion_Class`
- `Motion_Segment_ID`
- `Live_Green_FFT`
- `Live_POS_FFT`
- `Live_FS`

For the final live demo, the most important output is the motion-segment summary, which provides one final heart-rate estimate for each detected motion condition.

# Head Motion Classification

The framework automatically classifies head motion before physiological estimation.

The facial center is tracked over time and several motion descriptors are extracted:

- Horizontal amplitude
- Vertical amplitude
- Total displacement
- Direction changes
- Path length
- Motion ratios

The recording is then classified into one of the following categories:

- Stable
- Left-Right
- Zigzag

The selected motion class determines which adaptive correction rules are activated during physiological estimation.

# ROI Extraction

The framework uses facial regions to extract RGB traces related to blood-volume changes.

In the offline pipeline, multiple facial skin ROIs are used:

- Forehead
- Left cheek
- Right cheek

The average RGB values from these regions are combined to improve robustness against local illumination changes, partial occlusion, and tracking inaccuracies.

In the live implementation, only one green face box is displayed in the preview to keep the interface simple and readable. Internally, a central skin-oriented crop inside the detected face box is used for RGB extraction, while the saved video remains raw and does not include the overlay box.

This design prevents graphical annotations from corrupting the pixels used later for rPPG analysis.

---

# Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) Extraction

Two complementary rPPG approaches are employed.

## Green Channel Method

The green channel exhibits the strongest pulsatile modulation because hemoglobin absorbs green wavelengths more strongly than red and blue wavelengths.

```math
s_{green}(t)=G(t)
```

Advantages:

- Computationally efficient
- Strong pulsatile response
- Simple implementation

---

## POS Method

The Plane-Orthogonal-to-Skin (POS) algorithm projects normalized RGB traces onto a plane orthogonal to the skin-tone direction.

```math
S_1 = G-B
```

```math
S_2 = G+B-2R
```

```math
H=S_1+\alpha S_2
```

where

```math
\alpha=\frac{\sigma(S_1)}{\sigma(S_2)}
```

Advantages:

- Robust under illumination changes
- Improved motion resilience
- Better pulse separation

---

# Signal Conditioning

The extracted signals are:

1. Detrended
2. Normalized
3. Bandpass filtered

Heart-rate search range:

```text
60–100 BPM
```

Filtering suppresses:

- Illumination drift
- Sensor noise
- Motion artifacts
- High-frequency interference

---

# Heart Rate Estimation

Heart-rate estimation consists of several stages.

## Windowed FFT Analysis

The framework performs:

- Windowed FFT
- Zero-padding
- Peak interpolation
- Reliability estimation
- Multi-candidate ranking

Heart rate is estimated as:

```math
HR = f_{peak}\times60
```

</p>

Representative Zigzag example:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Green FFT HR | 74.70 BPM |
| POS FFT HR | 75.00 BPM |
| Final Consensus HR | 74.85 BPM |
| CMS50D Reference HR | 77.00 BPM |
| Signed Error | -2.15 BPM |
| MAE | 2.15 BPM |
| MAPE | 2.80 % |

---

## Peak Detection

Systolic peaks are detected in both Green and POS signals.

Inter-beat intervals are computed as:

```math
IBI_n=t_n-t_{n-1}
```

Peak-derived estimates are used to validate FFT estimates.

---

## Consensus Heart Rate

The final HR estimate is computed by combining:

- Green FFT estimate
- POS FFT estimate
- Window reliability
- Peak guidance information

The system automatically rejects inconsistent candidates and applies adaptive correction rules.

---

# Motion Artifact Correction

Several adaptive correction modules were developed.

## Motion Peak Guidance Correction

Corrects underestimated FFT estimates using peak information.

---

## Left-Right Candidate Guidance

Selects FFT candidates that agree with peak guidance.

---

## Low-Lock Rescue

Recovers estimates trapped in low-frequency artifacts.

---

## High-HR Rescue

Restores physiological frequencies suppressed by motion contamination.

---

# Respiratory Rate Estimation

Respiratory information is recovered from heart-rate variability.
